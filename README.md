# Course Network Analysis

## 1. Main Analysis

The notebook file consists of the following six major analytical steps:

### 1) Course Network Construction
- Constructed a monopartite course network based on linked skills between courses.
- Analyzed the network structure including Degree centrality and K-core decomposition

### 2) Constructing a Bipartite Network and Calculating Course Specificity
- Constrcuted a **bipartite course-skill network**.
- Calculated Course Specificity and Course Influence
- Compared course influence and specificity across sectors

### 3) Calculating Transferability for Four Economies and Skill Diversity
- Defined four future economies(Green Economy/Digital Economy/Fourth Industrial Revolution/Care Economy)
- Calculated job transferability to each economy for each course
- Measured Skill Diversity for each course

### 4) Integration into a Unified Course–Job Network
- Integrated:
  - Course–Skill network
  - Skill–Job network
- Constructed a unified Course–Job Transferability Network (T)

### 5) Course Influence Analysis
- Compared **course influence** across sectors
- Built **four regression models** to identify key predictors
- Conducted **multicollinearity analysis** using **VIF (Variance Inflation Factor)**

### 6) Oversupply Course Index Analysis
- Calculated the Oversupply Course Index based on course–job connections
- Compared oversupply across VET sectors
- Analyzed the relationship between transferability and oversupply for each VET sector

## 2. Network Robustness Check

### 1) `network_evaluation.py`
The python file constructs a course similarity network using a binarized course-skill matrix, which computes:

**Course-level metrics**:
  - Coverage (number of relevant skills)
  - Degree (number of similar courses)
  - Course Influence (coverage/degree)

**Network-level metrics**:
  - Link Density
  - Giant Component Ratio

**Outputs:**
- `course_data_{threshold}.csv`: Course-level metrics per threshold  
- `link_density_and_giant_component_ratio.csv`: Network-level metrics per threshold

### 2) `sensitivity_analysis.py`
The python file performs a sensitivity analysis by comparing course influence rankings and network structure across thresholds, using `0.60` as the baseline.

> This script depends on the output files generated by `network_evaluation.py`(`course_data_{threshold}.csv` and `link_density_and_giant_component_ratio.csv`).

**Outputs:**
- Summary of rank correlation and structural metric variations across thresholds  
- Useful for evaluating robustness of network structure and influence scores
