# Course_network_analysis

## 1. Main Analysis

The notebookfile consists of the following six major analytical steps:

---

### 1. Course Network Construction

- Constructed a **monopartite course network** based on shared skills between courses.
- Analyzed the network structure using:
  - **Degree centrality**
  - **K-core decomposition**
  - Other structural indicators

---

### 2. Constructing a Bipartite Network and Calculating Course Specificity

- Built a **bipartite course-skill network**.
- Calculated:
  - **Course Specificity** — how narrowly a course targets a skill set
  - **Course Influence** — ratio of coverage to degree
- Compared **influence and specificity across sectors**.
- Conducted **correlation analysis** between specificity and influence.

---

### 3. Calculate Transferability Value for Four Economies and Skill Diversity

- Defined **four future-oriented economies**:
  - Green Economy
  - Digital Economy
  - Fourth Industrial Revolution
  - Care Economy
- Calculated **course-level transferability** to each economy.
- Measured **Skill Diversity** per course.

---

### 4. Integration into a Unified Course–Job Network (T)

- Integrated:
  - **Course–Skill network**
  - **Skill–Job network**
- Constructed a **unified Course–Job transferability network (T)**.

---

### 5. Course Influence Analysis

- Compared **Course Influence values by sector**.
- Built **four regression models** to identify predictors of influence.
- Performed **multicollinearity diagnosis using VIF (Variance Inflation Factor)**.

---

### 6. Oversupply Index Analysis

- Calculated the **Oversupply Index** based on course–job connections.
- Compared **oversupply levels across sectors**.
- Analyzed the **correlation between transferability metrics and the oversupply index**.

## 2. Nework Robustness check

#### `network_evaluation.py`
The Python file constructs a course similarity network using a binarized course-skill matrix, which computes:

- Course-level metrics:
  - **Coverage** (number of relevant skills)
  - **Degree** (number of connections to other courses)
  - **Course Influence** (coverage/degree)

- Network metrics:
  - **Link Density**
  - **Giant Component Ratio**

**Outputs:**
- `course_data_{threshold}.csv`: Course-level metrics per threshold  
- `link_density_and_giant_component_ratio.csv`: Network metrics per threshold

#### `sensitivity_analysis.py`
The Python file performs a sensitivity analysis by comparing course influence rankings and network structure across different thresholds, using `0.60` as the baseline.

> The script depends on the output files generated by `network_evaluation.py` —  
specifically, it reads `course_data_{threshold}.csv` and `link_density_and_giant_component_ratio.csv`.

**Outputs:**
- Combined summary of rank correlation and structural metrics across thresholds  
- Useful for robustness checks and threshold sensitivity analysis
