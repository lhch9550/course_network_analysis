# Course_network_analysis

## 1. Main Analysis
## 2. Nework Robustness check

#### `network_evaluation.py`
The Python file constructs a course similarity network using a binarized course-skill matrix, which computes:

- Course-level metrics:
  - **Coverage** (number of relevant skills)
  - **Degree** (number of connections to other courses)
  - **Course Influence** (coverage/degree)

- Network metrics:
  - **Link Density**
  - **Giant Component Ratio**

**Outputs:**
- `course_data_{threshold}.csv`: Course-level metrics per threshold  
- `link_density_and_giant_component_ratio.csv`: Network metrics per threshold

#### `sensitivity_analysis.py`
The Python file performs a sensitivity analysis by comparing course influence rankings and network structure across different thresholds, using `0.60` as the baseline.

> The script depends on the output files generated by `network_evaluation.py` â€”  
specifically, it reads `course_data_{threshold}.csv` and `link_density_and_giant_component_ratio.csv`.

**Outputs:**
- Combined summary of rank correlation and structural metrics across thresholds  
- Useful for robustness checks and threshold sensitivity analysis
