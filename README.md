# Course Network Analysis

This repository provides code and resources for analyzing course networks based on course–skill relationships, sectoral mapping, and network robustness evaluation.

## 1. Main Analysis

The notebook file consists of the following six major analytical steps:

### 1) Course Network Construction
- Constructed a monopartite course network based on linked skills between courses
- Analyzed the network structure using including Degree centrality and K-core decomposition

### 2) Constructing a Bipartite Network and Calculating Course Specificity
- Constructed a bipartite course–skill network
- Calculated **Course Specificity** and **Course Influence** (coverage / degree)
- Compared course influence and specificity across VET sectors

### 3) Calculating Transferability for Four Economies and Skill Diversity
- Defined four future economies(Green Economy/Digital Economy/Fourth Industrial Revolution Economy/Care Economy)
- Calculated transferability scores for each course
- Measured Skill Diversity per course

### 4) Integration into a Unified Course–Job Network
- Integrated:
  - Course–Skill network
  - Skill–Job network
- Constructed a unified **Course-Job Network** (T) for the following analyssis

### 5) Course Influence Analysis
- Compared Course Influence across VET sectors
- Conducted four Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression models to explore how various independent variables are associated with Course Influence
- Conducted multicollinearity test using VIF (Variance Inflation Factor)

### 6) Oversupply Course Index Analysis
- Calculated the Oversupply Course Index based on course–job connections
- Compared oversupply across VET sectors
- Analyzed the sectorwise relationship between transferability and Oversupply Course Index

## 2. Network Robustness Test

### 1) `network_evaluation.py`
Constructs a course similarity network using a binarized course–skill matrix and computes:

**Course-level metrics:**
- Coverage (number of relevant skills)
- Degree (number of similar courses)
- Course Influence (coverage / degree)

**Network-level metrics:**
- Link Density
- Giant Component Ratio

**Outputs:**
- `course_data_{threshold}.csv`: Course-level metrics per threshold  
- `link_density_and_giant_component_ratio.csv`: Network-level metrics per threshold

### 2) `sensitivity_analysis.py`
Performs a sensitivity analysis by comparing course influence rankings and network structure across multiple thresholds, using `0.60` as the baseline.

> **Note:** This script depends on the output files generated by `network_evaluation.py`  
> (`course_data_{threshold}.csv` and `link_density_and_giant_component_ratio.csv`)
