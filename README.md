# Course Network Analysis

This repository provides tools and analysis for understanding course networks through skill alignment, sectoral mapping, and robustness testing.

## 1. Main Analysis

The notebook file consists of the following six major analytical steps:

### 1. Course Network Construction
- Constructed a **monopartite course network** based on shared skills between courses.
- Analyzed the network structure using:
  - **Degree centrality**
  - **K-core decomposition**
  - Other structural indicators

### 2. Constructing a Bipartite Network and Calculating Course Specificity
- Built a **bipartite course-skill network**.
- Calculated:
  - **Course Specificity** — how narrowly a course targets a skill set
  - **Course Influence** — ratio of coverage to degree
- Compared **influence and specificity across sectors**
- Conducted **correlation analysis** between specificity and influence

### 3. Calculating Transferability for Four Economies and Skill Diversity
- Defined four future-oriented economies:
  - Green Economy
  - Digital Economy
  - Fourth Industrial Revolution
  - Care Economy
- Calculated **course-level transferability** to each economy
- Measured **Skill Diversity** for each course

### 4. Integration into a Unified Course–Job Network (T)
- Integrated:
  - **Course–Skill network**
  - **Skill–Job network**
- Constructed a unified **Course–Job Transferability Network (T)**

### 5. Course Influence Analysis
- Compared **course influence** across sectors
- Built **four regression models** to identify key predictors
- Conducted **multicollinearity analysis** using **VIF (Variance Inflation Factor)**

### 6. Oversupply Index Analysis
- Calculated the **Oversupply Index** for course–job connections
- Compared oversupply across sectors
- Analyzed the **relationship between transferability and oversupply**

## 2. Network Robustness Check

### `network_evaluation.py`
Constructs a course similarity network using a binarized course-skill matrix, and computes:

- **Course-level metrics**:
  - Coverage (number of relevant skills)
  - Degree (number of connections to other courses)
  - Course Influence (coverage / degree)

- **Network-level metrics**:
  - Link Density
  - Giant Component Ratio

**Outputs:**
- `course_data_{threshold}.csv`: Course-level metrics per threshold  
- `link_density_and_giant_component_ratio.csv`: Network-level metrics per threshold

### `sensitivity_analysis.py`
Performs a sensitivity analysis by comparing course influence rankings and network structure across thresholds, using `0.60` as the baseline.

> This script depends on the output files generated by `network_evaluation.py`,  
specifically `course_data_{threshold}.csv` and `link_density_and_giant_component_ratio.csv`.

**Outputs:**
- Summary of rank correlation and structural metric variations across thresholds  
- Useful for evaluating robustness of network structure and influence scores
