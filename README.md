# Course Network Analysis

This repository provides code and resources for analyzing course networks based on course–skill relationships, sectoral mapping, and network robustness evaluation.

## 1. Main Analysis

The notebook file consists of the following six major analytical steps:

### 1) Course Network Construction
- Constructed a **monopartite course network** based on linked skills between courses.
- Analyzed the network structure using:
  - **Degree centrality**
  - **K-core decomposition**

### 2) Constructing a Bipartite Network and Calculating Course Specificity
- Constructed a **bipartite course–skill network**.
- Calculated:
  - **Course Specificity**
  - **Course Influence** (coverage / degree)
- Compared **course influence and specificity across VET sectors**

### 3) Calculating Transferability for Four Economies and Skill Diversity
- Defined four future economies:
  - Green Economy
  - Digital Economy
  - Fourth Industrial Revolution
  - Care Economy
- Calculated **job transferability scores** for each course
- Measured **Skill Diversity** per course

### 4) Integration into a Unified Course–Job Network
- Integrated:
  - **Course–Skill network**
  - **Skill–Job network**
- Constructed a unified **Course–Job Transferability Network (T)**

### 5) Course Influence Analysis
- Compared **Course Influence** across VET sectors
- Built **four regression models** to identify key predictors
- Conducted **multicollinearity analysis** using **VIF (Variance Inflation Factor)**

### 6) Oversupply Course Index Analysis
- Calculated the **Oversupply Course Index** based on course–job connections
- Compared oversupply across VET sectors
- Analyzed the relationship between **transferability** and **oversupply** by sector

## 2. Network Robustness Test

### 1) `network_evaluation.py`
Constructs a course similarity network using a binarized course–skill matrix and computes:

**Course-level metrics:**
- Coverage (number of relevant skills)
- Degree (number of similar courses)
- Course Influence (coverage / degree)

**Network-level metrics:**
- Link Density
- Giant Component Ratio

**Outputs:**
- `course_data_{threshold}.csv`: Course-level metrics per threshold  
- `link_density_and_giant_component_ratio.csv`: Network-level metrics per threshold

### 2) `sensitivity_analysis.py`
Performs a sensitivity analysis by comparing course influence rankings and network structure across multiple thresholds, using `0.60` as the baseline.

> **Note:** This script depends on the output files generated by `network_evaluation.py`  
> (`course_data_{threshold}.csv` and `link_density_and_giant_component_ratio.csv`)

**Outputs:**
- Summary of rank correlation and structural metric variations across thresholds  
- Useful for evaluating the robustness of network structure and influence scores
